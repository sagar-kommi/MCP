# Python File Operations - Important Things to Know

## Opening Files
- Use `open()` function with mode parameter:
  - 'r' - read (default)
  - 'w' - write (overwrites existing content)
  - 'a' - append (adds to end)
  - 'r+' - read and write
  - 'b' - binary mode (e.g., 'rb', 'wb')

## Context Managers (Best Practice)
- Always use `with` statement to ensure files are properly closed:
```python
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()
# File automatically closed after block
```

## Reading Files
- `read()` - reads entire file as string
- `readline()` - reads one line at a time
- `readlines()` - returns list of all lines
- Iterating: `for line in file:` - memory efficient for large files

## Writing Files
- `write()` - writes string to file (doesn't add newline)
- `writelines()` - writes list of strings
- Remember to add '\n' for newlines when needed

## File Paths
- Use `pathlib.Path` for modern, cross-platform path handling
- Or use `os.path.join()` for compatibility
- Avoid hardcoded slashes (/ or \)

## Error Handling
- Wrap file operations in try/except blocks
- Common exceptions: FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, IOError
```python
try:
    with open('file.txt') as f:
        data = f.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found")
```

## Binary Files
- Use 'b' mode for images, videos, PDFs, etc.
- Read/write bytes objects instead of strings

## File Position
- `seek(offset)` - move to specific position
- `tell()` - get current position

## Important Reminders
- Files are not closed until you close them or exit `with` block
- Writing mode 'w' deletes existing content
- Always handle exceptions for production code
- Use encoding parameter for non-UTF-8 files: `open('file.txt', encoding='utf-8')`
